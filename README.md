#'Archive Of Our Own' Scraper Tool

This tool is built to retrieve the full body of works from any fandom on the fanfiction site 'archiveofourown.org'. In its default implementation, it scrapes the works of the 'Star Wars : The Force Awakens' fandom, but the user can choose any fandom they wish by simply replacing the "header" variable in the parser.py file with the url for the first page of their desired fandom. To use, simply run parser.py in any interactive Python environment.
