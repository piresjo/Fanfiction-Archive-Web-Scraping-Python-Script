Python Script for Scraping the 'Archive Of Our Own' Fanfiction Site

The python script parser.py is built to retrieve the full body of works from any fandom on the fanfiction site 'archiveofourown.org'. In its default implementation, it scrapes the works of the 'Star Wars : The Force Awakens' fandom, but the user can choose any fandom they wish by simply replacing the "header" variable with the url for the first page of their desired fandom.
